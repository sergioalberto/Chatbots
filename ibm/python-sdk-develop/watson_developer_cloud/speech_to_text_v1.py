        Sends audio for speech recognition in sessionless mode.

        :param str model: The identifier of the model to be used for the recognition request. (Use `GET /v1/models` for a list of available models.).
        :param str customization_id: The GUID of a custom language model that is to be used with the request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The GUID of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify a `customization_id` with the request, you can use the `customization_weight` parameter to tell the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for speech recognition.   Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
        :param str version: The version of the specified base `model` that is to be used for speech recognition. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more information, see [Base model version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param str audio: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Audio to transcribe in the format specified by the `Content-Type` header. **Required for a non-multipart request.**.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, audio/webm;codecs=vorbis, or multipart/form-data.
        :param int inactivity_timeout: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity.
        :param list[str] keywords: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        :param float keywords_threshold: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
        :param int max_alternatives: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
        :param bool word_confidence: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: If `true`, confidence measure per word is returned.
        :param bool timestamps: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: If `true`, time alignment for each word is returned.
        :param bool profanity_filter: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool smart_formatting: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and Internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. If `false` (the default), no formatting is performed. Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool speaker_labels: NON-MULTIPART ONLY: Indicates whether labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange are to be included in the response. The default is `false`; no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.   To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the `GET /v1/models` method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`.

        Creates a job for an asynchronous recognition request.

        :param str audio: Audio to transcribe in the format specified by the `Content-Type` header.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
        :param str model: The identifier of the model to be used for the recognition request. (Use `GET /v1/models` for a list of available models.).
        :param str callback_url: A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The URL must already be successfully white-listed by using the `POST /v1/register_callback` method. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results. You can include the same callback URL with any number of job creation requests. Use the `user_token` query parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job to differentiate the callback notifications for the jobs.
        :param str events: If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are: `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job. `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete; you must use the `GET /v1/recognitions/{id}` method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted. `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete; the notification includes the results of the request. `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the job. Omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible; you can specify only of the two events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
        :param str user_token: If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service is to include with each callback notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
        :param int results_ttl: The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
        :param str customization_id: The GUID of a custom language model that is to be used with the request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The GUID of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify a `customization_id` with the request, you can use the `customization_weight` parameter to tell the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for speech recognition.   Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect  performance on non-domain phrases.
        :param str version: The version of the specified base `model` that is to be used with the request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more information, see [Base model version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param int inactivity_timeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity.
        :param list[str] keywords: Array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        :param float keywords_threshold: Confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
        :param int max_alternatives: Maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: Confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, confidence measure per word is returned.
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, time alignment for each word is returned.
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and Internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. If `false` (the default), no formatting is performed. Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool speaker_labels: Indicates whether labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange are to be included in the response. The default is `false`; no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.   To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the `GET /v1/models` method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`. You can also refer to [Speaker labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
